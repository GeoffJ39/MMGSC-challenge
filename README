assumptions:
- the EMV Chip AID is referring to the list of application ids obtained by getAidList
- the transactions list should update automatically based on any changes to any of the fields
- changing transaction serial number or customer pan number serves as a filter for certain transactions, but is not an input into the api call
- search was not implemented fully as I was unsure of the search constraints

running:

main.html is the main file here, and contains the transactions tab of the project, by running start ./main.html, it should launch a browser session
from here, the menu on the left hand side contains all 5 menu options, of which all of them other than transactions hasn't been implemented

inside transactions, the 5 input fields have been implemented with a range of dates for the dates option, all of the atm IDs fetched from getAtmList, as well as all the application IDs from getAidList
from there, once any of the input fields are changed, the transaction list should update accordingly (based on the commented out javascript code), however due to issues using getPastFutureTransactions, I was not able to get this feature fully working
